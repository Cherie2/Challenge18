# Social-Network-API-NoSQL

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to build an API for a social network web application. I will be implementing the appropriate routes with express.js and using MongoDB for the database. The web application wll be able to add, update, and delete users and their thoughts as well as users will be able to add or delete other users as friends. Users will also be able to leave/delete "reactions" to users thoughts.

In completing this project, I have learned the basic concepts of MongoDB and Express.js. I have also learned the benefits of utilizing modular routes to maintain cleaner code.
